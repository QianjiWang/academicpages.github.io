excerpt: 'This paper proposes a prior-guided deep reinforcement learning approach with multi-sensor fusion to enhance generalization in robotic assembly. It introduces a phased feature extraction method and a SAC algorithm integrated with GRU to efficiently learn skills like search, alignment, and insertion. The framework is validated on diverse objects, achieving a 30.16% reduction in training time and a 96.86% average success rate.'
